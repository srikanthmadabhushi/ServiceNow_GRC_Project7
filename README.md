Enterprise AI Risk Register & Governance (ServiceNow GRC)

# EX360-AIRR is an enterprise-grade AI Risk Governance solution built on ServiceNow GRC.
It demonstrates how organizations can systematically identify, assess, approve, and mitigate AI-specific risks with explainable logic and human oversight.

This project focuses on governing AI responsibly, ensuring accountability, auditability, and regulatory readiness as AI adoption scales.

# 🎯 Business Problem

As enterprises rapidly adopt AI systems, traditional risk registers fail to address AI-specific risks such as:

Algorithmic bias and fairness issues

Model drift and reliability degradation

Security and data exposure risks

Regulatory and compliance concerns

Lack of explainability and ownership

As a result, AI risks are often unmanaged, undocumented, or discovered too late—after incidents or regulatory scrutiny.

💡 Solution Overview

EX360-AIRR introduces an AI governance framework that:

Centralizes AI risks in a dedicated risk register

Automatically scores AI risks based on impact and likelihood

Classifies risks into Low / Medium / High

Enforces human-in-the-loop governance approvals

Automatically creates mitigation actions for approved risks

Maintains a complete, audit-ready risk lifecycle

🧠 Key Capabilities
1. AI Risk Identification

Centralized AI Risk Register

Model- and system-level risk capture

Categorization (Bias, Drift, Security, Compliance)

2. AI Risk Scoring & Classification

Automated risk score calculation

Impact × Likelihood evaluation

Risk levels: Low / Medium / High

Explainable AI risk insights

3. AI Risk Governance & Approvals

Human-in-the-loop approval workflows

Executive review for high AI risks

Fully auditable governance decisions

4. AI Risk Mitigation Tracking

Automatic mitigation record creation

Ownership and target dates enforced

Status tracking: Planned / In Progress / Completed

5. Executive Visibility

Central view of AI risk exposure

Approved risks pending mitigation

Ongoing mitigation status tracking

This project reflects real-world AI governance patterns emerging across regulated enterprises.

🚀 Why This Project Matters

EX360-AIRR demonstrates how organizations can govern AI without slowing innovation by:

Making AI risks explainable

Keeping humans accountable for decisions

Enforcing mitigation before issues escalate

This moves AI adoption from experimentation to enterprise-grade, governed deployment.
